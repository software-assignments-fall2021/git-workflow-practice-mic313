# Paragraph About What I Found Interesting

I think this article is an interesting example of a software company 
making an actual effort to make sure that their development teams are
inclusive in a way that is more substantial than simply hiring a person
of color and launching vague "diversity and inclusion" initiatives. By
not only helping students of color afford an education, but also including
those same students in their company after graduation, it's a great way 
to correct some of the disparities in the tech industry. It also
include better diversity of thought in the company itself.
