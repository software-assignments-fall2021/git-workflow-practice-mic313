# Paragraph About What I Found Interesting

I think this article is an interesting example of a software company  
making an actual effort to make sure that their development teams are
inclusive in a way that is more substantial than simply hiring a person
of color and launching vague "diversity and inclusion" initiatives. By
not only helping students of color afford an education, but also includes
those same students in their company after graduation. It's a great way 
to not only correct some of the disparities in the tech industry, but also
include better diversity of thought in the company itself.
